    <p class="text2">
       Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions.
       It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments.
    Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world,
    cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions.
     When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger.
     Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.

    <h3 class="text"> Why Crypto? </h3>
    <p class="text2">
        Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money that is based on blockchain technology and secured by cryptography.
         To understand cryptocurrency, one needs to first understand three terminologies – blockchain,
          decentralization, and cryptography. In simple words, blockchain in the context of cryptocurrency is a digital ledger whose access is distributed among authorized users. 
            This ledger records transactions related to a range of assets, like money, house, or even intellectual property.
